# [Collatz](https://github.com/Skenvy/Collatz): [Go](https://github.com/Skenvy/Collatz/tree/main/go)
Functions related to [the Collatz/Syracuse/3N+1 problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture), implemented in [Go](https://go.dev/).
## This is pre-development to verify the CICD pipeline.
## Getting Started
To [install the latest](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Skenvy/Collatz/go);
```
go get -u github.com/Skenvy/Collatz/go
```
### Developing
#### The first time setup
```
git clone https://github.com/Skenvy/Collatz.git
cd Collatz/go
make godoc
```
#### Iterative development
1. `make docs_local` to start a local server to browse the files taken from, and generated by, godoc.
## Usage
Provides the basic functionality to interact with the Collatz conjecture.
The parameterisation uses the same `(P,a,b)` notation as Conway's generalisations.
Besides the function and reverse function, there is also functionality to retrieve the hailstone sequence, the "stopping time"/"total stopping time", or tree-graph. 
The only restriction placed on parameters is that both `P` and `a` can't be `0`.
