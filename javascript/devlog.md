"JavaScript" is a hard target to pin down precisely what would be the best way to learn it, without first learning the history of the language, as an evolution of ECMA Script; see [ECMAScript Language Specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/) and [ECMAScript Internationalization API Specification](https://tc39.es/ecma402/) for the _most_ "source of truth" as it gets for JavaScript (even if a cumbersome point of reference to get up and running qith a project quickly, they are important to be aware of). As from the start the JavaScript ecosystem was fragmented across various browsers, there is no single source of truth for how a "JavaScript Engine" enacts the ECMAScript language spec, so it's worth knowing of the major engines (with there being a distinction between the [JavaScript Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine) and the [Browser Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_engine)).
* [ChakraCore](https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore) is an evolution of the Microsoft IE JS Engine, Chakra.
* [JavaScriptCore](https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/blob/main/Source/JavaScriptCore/API/JavaScriptCore.h) (a part of [WebKit](https://webkit.org/)) ([opensource.apple](https://opensource.apple.com/projects/webkit/)) (or on [github](https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit))
    * [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (or on [github](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun)), a new and still experimental runtime which "embeds" JavaScriptCore.
* [SpiderMonkey](https://spidermonkey.dev/) ([firefox-source-docs](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/js/index.html)) ([mozilla-central/source](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/js/src)) ([Gecko on github](https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev))
* [V8](https://github.com/v8/v8) ([googlesource](https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8.git)) [v8.dev](https://v8.dev/)
    * [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/), or on [github](https://github.com/nodejs/node), is the most widely used JS Engine, and is built on V8.
    * [Deno](https://deno.land/), or on [github](https://github.com/denoland/deno), is also built on V8, with many more features OotB.

The three "server side runtimes" are Node (V8), Deno (V8), or the recent and experimental Bun (JavaScriptCore). Bun's package management is "npm compatible", so if our goal is to create a JavaScript package, we need to focus on Node and Deno.
* Node packages can be hosted on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (see [Getting started](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started)), and are manually `npm publish`'d.
* Deno packages can be seen on [Deno Third Party Modules](https://deno.land/x) (see [Adding a module](https://deno.land/add_module)), and are cached from public GitHub repos.
* We also want to target the [github hosted npm registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry) (also see [Publishing Node.js packages](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-nodejs-packages)).

At the time of writing this, `npm` already has a [`collatz` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/collatz) (from [this repo](https://github.com/partkyle/collatz)), and `deno.land/x` has [collatz_wasm](https://deno.land/x/collatz_wasm@0.0.1) (which is [also on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/collatz-wasm)) (from [this repo](https://github.com/hexagon6/collatz-wasm)). For github hosted packages, we'll look at [this search](https://github.com/search?q=collatz&type=registrypackages). Oddly enough, at the time of writing this, I was getting ready to say there is no `npm` package with the name `collatz` in the github `npm` registry, as it was not appearing without being logged in, but when I searched again from a browser I was logged in with, [this package](https://github.com/pavan142/collatz/pkgs/npm/collatz) appeared.

A good resource for starting to learn "JavaScript" would be [mozilla's developer decs on JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) ([or guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)).
