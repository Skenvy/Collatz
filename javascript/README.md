# [Collatz](https://github.com/Skenvy/Collatz): [JavaScript](https://github.com/Skenvy/Collatz/tree/main/javascript) ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¥
Functions related to [the Collatz/Syracuse/3N+1 problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture), implemented in [JavaScript](https://tc39.es/ecma262/).
## Getting Started
[To install the latest from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@skenvy/collatz);
```sh
npm i @skenvy/collatz
```
## Usage
Provides the basic functionality to interact with the Collatz conjecture.
The parameterisation uses the same `(P,a,b)` notation as Conway's generalisations.
Besides the function and reverse function, there is also functionality to retrieve the hailstone sequence, the "stopping time"/"total stopping time", or tree-graph. 
The only restriction placed on parameters is that both `P` and `a` can't be `0`.
