# Security Policy
## Supported Versions
As this is currently building to the first major version, all language's implementations are supported forward only. Bugs present in the latest version of each may be patched and contribute to successive patch versions. If a bug exists in an older version and no longer exists in a newer version, it is suggested to update to the newer version.

When the project reaches of the stage of possibly passing the first major version from 1 to 2, if a bug is found to exist in version 1 but is not in version 2, this stance may be recondired.
