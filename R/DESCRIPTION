Title: Functions related to the Collatz/Syracuse/3N+1 problem
Description: Provides the basic functionality to interact with the Collatz conjecture.
    The parameterisation uses the same (P,a,b) notation as Conway's generalisations.
    Besides the function and reverse function, there is also functionality to retrieve
    the hailstone sequence, the "stopping time"/"total stopping time", or tree-graph. 
    The only restriction placed on parameters is that both P and a can't be 0.
