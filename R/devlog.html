<p><a href="https://www.r-project.org/" class="external-link">R</a>, and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" class="external-link">CRAN</a>. There’s also <a href="https://developer.r-project.org/TechDocs/" class="external-link">R Technical Papers</a>, <a href="https://www.r-project.org/help.html" class="external-link">Getting Help with R</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html" class="external-link">The R Manuals</a> (which includes <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html" class="external-link">Writing R Extensions (covers how to create your own packages)</a>), and <a href="https://www.r-project.org/certification.html" class="external-link">Certification</a> (which includes <a href="https://www.r-project.org/doc/R-SDLC.pdf" class="external-link">R: Software Development Life Cycle</a>). Besides what these may include about “how to” start writing a package, the CRAN page includes links to <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html" class="external-link">CRAN Repository Policy</a> and <a href="https://xmpalantir.wu.ac.at/cransubmit/" class="external-link">Submit a package to CRAN</a> which are also useful to read to see what the process expects!</p>
<p>After writing further down, it’s probably worthwhile retroactively coming back up here and just saying that it’s impossible to learn R without seeing <a href="https://github.com/hadley" class="external-link">Hadley Wickham</a> appearing behind every curtin, and many of the packages we end up using here come from him. So while I have intentionally tried to stay free of the shackles of an IDE and run everything through scripts / recipes, <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/" class="external-link">RStudio</a> might actually be worth checking out.</p>
<p>Previously, I’ve been using <a href="https://github.com/trending/r?since=weekly" class="external-link">GitHub Trending for <x> language</x></a> as a starting point to look at how highely ranked existing repos chose to organise their projects, but the most stars in the last week for an R repo is <a href="https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022" class="external-link">this one</a>. So I’ll collect a few other examples to look at – {<a href="https://github.com/rstudio/shiny" class="external-link">rstudio/shiny</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2" class="external-link">tidyverse/ggplot2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown" class="external-link">r-lib/pkgdown</a>, <a href="https://github.com/satijalab/seurat" class="external-link">satijalab/seurat</a>, <a href="https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn" class="external-link">facebookexperimental/Robyn</a>}. A blog that might be useful is <a href="https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/" class="external-link">this</a>.</p>
<p>Before beginning it’s worth mentioning that this might be the “stick in the mud” language as far as the goal of having complete CICD for all languages goes, being that the CRAN submission page appears to intend a manual submission of code, although it might be possible to hack something together that automates interacting with the form to upload a submission, it is clearly not intended. <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions&amp;query=R" class="external-link">A search for “R” in the actions marketplace</a> not only reveals no action for automating the submission of a package, but in what feels like perverse serendipity, the fourth result in <strong><em>my</em></strong> <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/julia-r-r-release-and-register" class="external-link">Julia: R&amp;R ~ Release and Register</a> package! The <em>top</em> hit is this <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/r-actions" class="external-link">R-actions</a> which doesn’t look “official” but could be worth while reading, even if I’d enjoy the challenge of trying to implement it myself. The most “official” appears to be a handful of actions by the organisation “insightsengineering”, <a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Agithub-actions+org%3Ainsightsengineering&amp;type=Repositories" class="external-link">here</a>. Going to google to see if an action exists to install R in a CI step reveals this <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/actions" class="external-link">r-lib/actions</a> repository, which <em>is</em> an official repo with a bunch of actions, which don’t appear on the marketplace because all the actions are bundled into one repo!</p>
<p>Being Australian, we’ll download the latest R from the <a href="https://cran.csiro.au/" class="external-link">csiro mirror</a> for windows and follow <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/" class="external-link">this</a> for WSL. While we wait for these to download, we’ll checkout <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Package-structure" class="external-link">Writing R Extensions 1.1 Package structure</a>. We’ll start off with a “Hello World” file, which prompts to download <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r" class="external-link">this extension</a>. Part way through filling out the DESCRIPTION file, I had to look up whether the apache license would be acceptable for it, as it makes explicit mention of a few others as the “main” license. It’s also worth noting that a few of the examples I’ve looked at all fulfill the required existence of <code>./man/*.Rd</code> via “roxygen2”? Will need to look into that!</p>
<p>I’d like a “first” check to run <code>R CMD check .</code>, but it appears in doesn’t like the recommended use of an <code>Authors@R: c(person("Nathan", "Levett", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "nathan.a.z.levett@gmail.com"))</code> line in the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> in place of the normal <code>Author</code> and <code>Maintainer</code> fields. Although, the CRAN package policy states “Please ensure that <code>R CMD check --as-cran</code> has been run <em>on the tarball to be uploaded</em>”, so I suppose we’ll avoid checking “here” and build before checking. Also although earlier there was a page with a list of licenses that were common in R, the list of those likely to be accepted for CRAN are <a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/share/licenses/license.db" class="external-link">here</a>, which <em>does</em> include Apache v2. There’s also a more comprehensive list of all <em>previously</em> distributed packages <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/" class="external-link">here</a>, which is more than just the “current” ones. But it also appears searching for Collatz in there yields nothing. There’s also an “<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/incoming/" class="external-link">incoming</a>” list of packages prior to actual approval that’s worth bookmarking. Lastly, while earlier the “submit” page was yielding <a href="https://xmpalantir.wu.ac.at/cransubmit/" class="external-link">this link</a>, it appears a more accurate link exists on the policy page, which links to <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html" class="external-link">submit here</a>. There’s also a “<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/submission_checklist.html" class="external-link">submission checklist</a>”.</p>
<p>There’s a few “arbitrary integer precision” packages on CRAN, but it doesn’t seem like there’s an in built arbitrary integer package, so we’ll need to pick from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gmp/index.html" class="external-link">gmp</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rmpfr/index.html" class="external-link">Rmpfr</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bignum/index.html" class="external-link">bignum</a>, or <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Ryacas/index.html" class="external-link">Ryacas</a>.</p>
<p>Even without the constant suggestion of simplicity that Go had, the lack of simplicity in installing R packages is starting to become very frustrating, with the constant need to compare errors across a handful of sites to confirm why each new attempt to progressively install more of the packages is not working. The installation on the windows side keeps popping up a message that the language server is required, but even when opening as admin, the installation it’s attempting, <code>C:\Program Files\R\R-4.2.1\bin\R.exe --silent --slave --no-save --no-restore -e install.packages('languageserver', repos='https://cran.r-project.org/')</code> keeps failing with the message that the package doesn’t exist for this version, and trying to <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools" class="external-link"><code>Rscript -e 'install.packages("devtools")'</code></a> from WSL not only took around about an hour to run through, but ended up with 25 Warnings of packages that it couldn’t install, with recommendations for a whole host of debian packages that need to be installed first (but which only revealed their necessity on subsequent iterative installation attempts). So even while R doesn’t have the same pretense of simplicity that Go did, it’s safe to say its package management is anything <em>BUT</em> simple. More annoyingly than packages not being installable is that regardless of a package failing or not, other downstream packages that rely on it will still attempt to download and install and then fail on a missing dependency that it should already have known failed earlier. This, coupled with the installation of the <code>stringi</code> package somehow not working as it always downloads a differently sized package to what it expects and errors out (as it timesout on the 60 seconds to download 7.7Mb), means that having run the command to install devtools multiple times, I’ve realised that it is not idempotent, and is quite thirsty, having taking up 4Gb of space so far. The difficulty in getting something so basic working does make me question why the language is so popular, or at least, for creating packages in. It’s very frustrating that is also keeps failing on installing a “Font Manager” library. It’s also so anti-idempotent that during one round of installing dependencies, it <em>removed</em> one of the ones it succeded at installing only a few minutes earlier and now won’t reinstall it after a few attempts. It took around 20 attempts, but everything has finally downloaded and installed, with a hefty list of debian packages that are also required for devtools.</p>
<p>While there’s a lot of ways that generally installing packages in the above could be less painful, it could also be a lot less painful if the devtools package itself made reference to what its minimum supported environments would require already installed to allow it to work. My <code>make setup_debian</code> recipe attempts to do this partially for the current release, although it wasn’t a fresh ubuntu image, so I can’t guarantee it didn’t also already have other required packages installed and thus not added to that list. I tried to see about R related image on docker-hub, which has <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/r-base" class="external-link">this <em>docker official</em> image</a> which points to the repo <a href="https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker" class="external-link">rocker-org/rocker</a>. Searching that page for any mention of “devtools” yields a link to the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/tidyverse" class="external-link">rocker/tidyverse</a> images which themselves then link to the repo <a href="https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2" class="external-link">rocker-org/rocker-versioned2</a>, whose <a href="https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/blob/30c72e028f4c6cf4d3c031fb64b5b0d63cc94cf7/dockerfiles/tidyverse_4.2.1.Dockerfile" class="external-link">latest tidyverse dockerfile</a> (besides starting off from the rstudio base) runs <a href="https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/blob/30c72e028f4c6cf4d3c031fb64b5b0d63cc94cf7/scripts/install_tidyverse.sh" class="external-link">this script</a>, which does <a href="https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/blob/30c72e028f4c6cf4d3c031fb64b5b0d63cc94cf7/scripts/install_tidyverse.sh#L18" class="external-link">this apt insall</a> set of libraries. It’s not necessary right now to identify a minimum set of installable libraries for devtools, but a superset of that information is definitely obtainable.</p>
<p>We’ll pick <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=gmp" class="external-link">gmp</a> (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gmp/gmp.pdf" class="external-link">pdf</a>) for arb ints. Which appears to work like magic, woah. It’s basically the “it’s free real-estate” meme. It using the bigz class it provides instead of ints adds no additional overhead or even requires multiple function definitions, so it can stay as tidy as python, even though it did need a library for arbitrary integers, it’s <em>real neat</em>. So with the function and reverse function appearing to work, lets have a look at introducing unit tests. The main name that’s always popping up is “<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat" class="external-link">testthat</a>” (which has a staggeringly large “Reverse suggests” list, multiple times as long as the devtools package). We can initiate “testthat” with <code>Rscript -e 'usethis::use_testthat()'</code>. Running this provides the source of so many reverse suggestions with the second action it takes being “✔ Adding ‘testthat’ to Suggests field in DESCRIPTION”, which I was already planning on adding, but it occurs to me that it’s funny that running “testthat” adds itself to the suggestions, but devtools did not add itself to the suggestions. To continue setting up tests, we can run <code>Rscript -e 'usethis::use_test("Collatz")'</code>, and copy over the tests used from the java version.</p>
<p>I realised upon testing for the first time in the gh action that it would be irritatingly long each time to install dependencies that have to recompile, and why do so, when we can just reuse the tidyverse images provided above, which exist far back enough to have a 3.5.0 tagged image, which is the earliest version I want to test on (being the minimum version of the only dependency, gmp). With tests now working in the workflow, the last things to check out are <a href="https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/" class="external-link">pkgdown</a> for creating a site, but first, <a href="https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/" class="external-link">roxygen2</a> for generating the <code>./man/</code>! It seems that Roxygen doesn’t like the DESCRIPTION not including <code>Encoding: UTF-8</code> which is against the CRAN standard of ASCII, and I’d been trying to stick with that, but roxygen adds too much benefit to not use it. With a minimum setup of roxygen, let’s have a look at using pkgdown. Start with <code>Rscript -e 'usethis::use_pkgdown()'</code>.</p>
<p>I did a fair amount of experimenting with setting up the generating of the pdf without commenting about it here, but I finally got it working. Locally it would work 50/50 (for some reason it just casually fails half the time, and works fine the other half of the time, on back to back invocations with no background changes..) but it took installing the debian texinfo package in the rocker/tidyverse container to get it to manage to generate the pdf in the workflow. We’re now ready to; 1. <code>git checkout --orphan gh-pages-R</code> 1. <code>rm .git/index ; git clean -fdx</code> 1. <code>git commit -m "Initial empty orphan" --allow-empty</code> 1. <code>git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages-R</code></p>
<p>Which means we now have the target for where to deploy docs to, and then test that they are fine to merge to the main gh-pages branch. A funny quirk of pkgdown appears to be that it requires newlines above header lines in the markdown files that it converts to the home page, so the readme here will be formatted slightly differently, although visually inconsequentially so, to all the others. I’ve reached the stage where I can generate docs, and test successfully across ubuntu, mac and windows, and complete a CRAN check on the latest. So we’ll merge to main now to get the 0.1.0 release into main before then adding vignettes and the hailstone and tree graph functions.</p>
