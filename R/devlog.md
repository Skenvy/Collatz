# Devlog
[R](https://www.r-project.org/), and [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). There's also [R Technical Papers](https://developer.r-project.org/TechDocs/), [Getting Help with R](https://www.r-project.org/help.html), [The R Manuals](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html) (which includes [Writing R Extensions (covers how to create your own packages)](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html)), and [Certification](https://www.r-project.org/certification.html) (which includes [R: Software Development Life Cycle](https://www.r-project.org/doc/R-SDLC.pdf)). Besides what these may include about "how to" start writing a package, the CRAN page includes links to [CRAN Repository Policy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html) and [Submit a package to CRAN](https://xmpalantir.wu.ac.at/cransubmit/) which are also useful to read to see what the process expects!

Previously, I've been using [GitHub Trending for <X> language](https://github.com/trending/r?since=weekly) as a starting point to look at how highely ranked existing repos chose to organise their projects, but the most stars in the last week for an R repo is [this one](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022). So I'll collect a few other examples to look at -- {[rstudio/shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny), [tidyverse/ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2), [r-lib/pkgdown](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown), [satijalab/seurat](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat), [facebookexperimental/Robyn](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn)}.

Before beginning it's worth mentioning that this might be the "stick in the mud" language as far as the goal of having complete CICD for all languages goes, being that the CRAN submission page appears to intend a manual submission of code, although it might be possible to hack something together that automates interacting with the form to upload a submission, it is clearly not intended. [A search for "R" in the actions marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions&query=R) not only reveals no action for automating the submission of a package, but in what feels like perverse serendipity, the fourth result in ***my*** [Julia: R&R ~ Release and Register](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/julia-r-r-release-and-register) package! The _top_ hit is this [R-actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/r-actions) which doesn't look "official" but could be worth while reading, even if I'd enjoy the challenge of trying to implement it myself. The most "official" appears to be a handful of actions by the organisation "insightsengineering", [here](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Agithub-actions+org%3Ainsightsengineering&type=Repositories). Going to google to see if an action exists to install R in a CI step reveals this [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) repository, which _is_ an official repo with a bunch of actions, which don't appear on the marketplace because all the actions are bundled into one repo!

Being Australian, we'll download the latest R from the [csiro mirror](https://cran.csiro.au/) for windows and follow [this](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/) for WSL. While we wait for these to download, we'll checkout [Writing R Extensions 1.1 Package structure](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Package-structure). We'll start off with a "Hello World" file, which prompts to download [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r). Part way through filling out the DESCRIPTION file, I had to look up whether the apache license would be acceptable for it, as it makes explicit mention of a few others as the "main" license. It's also worth noting that a few of the examples I've looked at all fulfill the required existence of `./man/*.Rd` via "roxygen2"? Will need to look into that!
