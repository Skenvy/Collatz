# Devlog
[R](https://www.r-project.org/), and [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). There's also [R Technical Papers](https://developer.r-project.org/TechDocs/), [Getting Help with R](https://www.r-project.org/help.html), [The R Manuals](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html) (which includes [Writing R Extensions (covers how to create your own packages)](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html)), and [Certification](https://www.r-project.org/certification.html) (which includes [R: Software Development Life Cycle](https://www.r-project.org/doc/R-SDLC.pdf)). Besides what these may include about "how to" start writing a package, the CRAN page includes links to [CRAN Repository Policy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html) and [Submit a package to CRAN](https://xmpalantir.wu.ac.at/cransubmit/) which are also useful to read to see what the process expects!

Previously, I've been using [GitHub Trending for <X> language](https://github.com/trending/r?since=weekly) as a starting point to look at how highely ranked existing repos chose to organise their projects, but the most stars in the last week for an R repo is [this one](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022). So I'll collect a few other examples to look at -- {[rstudio/shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny), [tidyverse/ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2), [r-lib/pkgdown](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown), [satijalab/seurat](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat), [facebookexperimental/Robyn](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn)}.

Before beginning it's worth mentioning that this might be the "stick in the mud" language as far as the goal of having complete CICD for all languages goes, being that the CRAN submission page appears to intend a manual submission of code, although it might be possible to hack something together that automates interacting with the form to upload a submission, it is clearly not intended. [A search for "R" in the actions marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions&query=R) not only reveals no action for automating the submission of a package, but in what feels like perverse serendipity, the fourth result in ***my*** [Julia: R&R ~ Release and Register](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/julia-r-r-release-and-register) package! The _top_ hit is this [R-actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/r-actions) which doesn't look "official" but could be worth while reading, even if I'd enjoy the challenge of trying to implement it myself. The most "official" appears to be a handful of actions by the organisation "insightsengineering", [here](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Agithub-actions+org%3Ainsightsengineering&type=Repositories). Going to google to see if an action exists to install R in a CI step reveals this [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) repository, which _is_ an official repo with a bunch of actions, which don't appear on the marketplace because all the actions are bundled into one repo!

Being Australian, we'll download the latest R from the [csiro mirror](https://cran.csiro.au/) for windows and follow [this](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/) for WSL. While we wait for these to download, we'll checkout [Writing R Extensions 1.1 Package structure](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Package-structure). We'll start off with a "Hello World" file, which prompts to download [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r). Part way through filling out the DESCRIPTION file, I had to look up whether the apache license would be acceptable for it, as it makes explicit mention of a few others as the "main" license. It's also worth noting that a few of the examples I've looked at all fulfill the required existence of `./man/*.Rd` via "roxygen2"? Will need to look into that!

I'd like a "first" check to run `R CMD check .`, but it appears in doesn't like the recommended use of an `Authors@R: c(person("Nathan", "Levett", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "nathan.a.z.levett@gmail.com"))` line in the `DESCRIPTION` in place of the normal `Author` and `Maintainer` fields. Although, the CRAN package policy states "Please ensure that `R CMD check --as-cran` has been run _on the tarball to be uploaded_", so I suppose we'll avoid checking "here" and build before checking. Also although earlier there was a page with a list of licenses that were common in R, the list of those likely to be accepted for CRAN are [here](https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/share/licenses/license.db), which _does_ include Apache v2. There's also a more comprehensive list of all _previously_ distributed packages [here](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/), which is more than just the "current" ones. But it also appears searching for Collatz in there yields nothing. There's also an "[incoming](https://cran.r-project.org/incoming/)" list of packages prior to actual approval that's worth bookmarking. Lastly, while earlier the "submit" page was yielding [this link](https://xmpalantir.wu.ac.at/cransubmit/), it appears a more accurate link exists on the policy page, which links to [submit here](https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html). There's also a "[submission checklist](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/submission_checklist.html)".

There's a few "arbitrary integer precision" packages on CRAN, but it doesn't seem like there's an in built arbitrary integer package, so we'll need to pick from [gmp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gmp/index.html), [Rmpfr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rmpfr/index.html), [bignum](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bignum/index.html), or [Ryacas](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Ryacas/index.html).

Even without the constant suggestion of simplicity that Go had, the lack of simplicity in installing R packages is starting to become very frustrating, with the constant need to compare errors across a handful of sites to confirm why each new attempt to progressively install more of the packages is not working. The installation on the windows side keeps popping up a message that the language server is required, but even when opening as admin, the installation it's attempting, `C:\Program Files\R\R-4.2.1\bin\R.exe --silent --slave --no-save --no-restore -e install.packages('languageserver', repos='https://cran.r-project.org/')` keeps failing with the message that the package doesn't exist for this version, and trying to [`Rscript -e 'install.packages("devtools")'`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools) from WSL not only took around about an hour to run through, but ended up with 25 Warnings of packages that it couldn't install, with recommendations for a whole host of debian packages that need to be installed first. So even while R doesn't have the same pretense of simplicity that Go did, it's safe to say it's anything _BUT_ Out of the Box functional. More annoyingly than packages not being installable is that regardless of a package failing or not, other downstream packages that rely on it will still attempt to download and install and then fail on a missing dependency that it should already have known failed earlier. This, coupled with the installation of the `stringi` package somehow not working as it always downloads a differently sized package to what it expects and errors out (as it timesout on the 60 seconds to download 7.7Mb), means that having run the command to install devtools multiple times, I've realised that it is not idempotent, and is quite thirsty, having taking up 4Gb of space so far. The difficulty in getting something so basic working does make me question why the language is so popular, or at least, for creating packages in. It's very frustrating that is also keeps failing on installing a "Font Manager" library. It's also so anti-idempotent that during one round of installing dependencies, it _removed_ one of the ones it succeded at installing only a few minutes earlier and now won't reinstall it after a few attempts. It took around 20 attempts, but everything has finally downloaded and installed, with a hefty list of debian packages that are also required for devtools.
