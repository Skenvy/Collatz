# [Collatz](https://github.com/Skenvy/Collatz): [R](https://github.com/Skenvy/Collatz/tree/main/R) üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüîµü¶ú
Functions related to [the Collatz/Syracuse/3N+1 problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture), implemented in [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

## Getting Started
[To install the latest from github, with devtools](https://github.com/Skenvy/Collatz/tree/main/R);
```sh
Rscript -e 'devtools::install_github("Skenvy/Collatz", subdir="R")'
```
It's _not on CRAN_, but if it does get added, then this would also be relevant.
[To install the latest from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=collatz);
```sh
Rscript -e 'install.packages("collatz")'
```

## Usage
Provides the basic functionality to interact with the Collatz conjecture.
The parameterisation uses the same `(P,a,b)` notation as Conway's generalisations.
Besides the function and reverse function, there is also functionality to retrieve the hailstone sequence, the "stopping time"/"total stopping time", or tree-graph. 
The only restriction placed on parameters is that both `P` and `a` can't be `0`.

## Developing

### The first time setup
On a debian system, this _should_ be most of the required setup.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Skenvy/Collatz.git && cd Collatz/R && sudo make setup_debian && make setup && make setup_libraries
```

### Iterative development
* `make docs_local` to start a [local server](http://localhost:4321) to browse the docs generated by roxygen2, pkgdown, covr, Rd2pdf and TinyTex, served by servr.
* `make full_test` will verify the integrity of the package after passing the tests, as passing the tests is a lower threshold than package structure.
