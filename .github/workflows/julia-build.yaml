        # but deploydocs is designed around a push of a tag, and we've chosen to frob the    #
        # GITHUB_REF to make it a tag for deploydocs, then we need to uncomment the disallow #
        # on both release and register, and swap the version in the project. If doing that   #
        # though, keep in mind that the test step doesn't trigger on pushes to main, because #
        # it assumes this will trigger on any required build push to main after a PR. So be  #
        # careful not to change any actual ./julia/ code when debugging the deploydocs.      #
