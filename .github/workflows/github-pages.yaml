  # Ideologically, this is what will run on a push to any 'gh-pages-*' branch;
  # but this was set up at a time that pushes from other workflows that use the
  # GITHUB_TOKEN wouldn't trigger another, downstream, workflow, so it was
  # necessary at the time to invoke it with a call.
  #
  # Subsequent to that, we then needed to also include sphinx generated sites in
  # the gh-pages build, that was already set up to make use of being built with
  # jekyll, we need to maintain the "merge" functionality, and introduce a pages
  # build and deploy.
  #
  # We don't want pushes to the gh-pages branch to build this every time, as if
  # we are manually editting the branch, we don't want it to build WIP changes,
  # but we it'd be reasonable to couple manually editting with manually running
  # a workflow_dispatch.
