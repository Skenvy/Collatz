"""
Provides the basic functionality to interact with the Collatz conjecture.
The parameterisation uses the same (P,a,b) notation as Conway's generalisations.
Besides the function and reverse function, there is also functionality to
retrieve the hailstone sequence, the "stopping time"/"total stopping time", or
tree-graph.
