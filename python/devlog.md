# Devlog
At the moment, a [python package already exists on pypi](https://pypi.org/project/collatz/), owned by [NGeorgescu](https://github.com/NGeorgescu/collatz), and there appear to be more recent uploads with more squashed names, such as {[simple-collatz](https://pypi.org/project/simple-collatz/)|[collatzconj](https://pypi.org/project/collatzconj/)|[lychrel](https://pypi.org/project/lychrel/)}. 
#
We can follow the [pypi packaging doc](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/) for the recommended steps to start setting up, although it looks like the '~/src' directory is a new recommendation, which seems to have a non inconsequential effect on imports, and the current tutorial on python.org appears to have no follow up to default testing recommendations besides "make a test folder for later..", although `from src import <thing>` works fine.
#
Because the overall project layout doesn't include the license in the python folder from which the build is run, might need to look into using [the manifest file](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/using-manifest-in/) to add it. Once we've [set up testing with pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/getting-started.html#get-started), will have a look at [the recommended github actions](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/). Also worth double checking [the actual recommendation on aligning the readme with pypi's expectations for it](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/making-a-pypi-friendly-readme/).
#
Looping back to this after completing the julia implementation, I'd like to thank [NGeorgescu](https://github.com/NGeorgescu/collatz) for being generous with passing over the project name.
