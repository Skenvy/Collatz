# Collatz
Functions related to the Collatz/Syracuse/3N+1 problem, prospectively implemented in python/R/julia/go/java/? with notes in LaTeX
## Plan
Each language's implementation should share the same functionality, or as close to it as possible, such that a consistent usability is delivered across all languages' implementations.
### Basic functionality.
#### Core functionality for v1
* The **function**, _optionally_ parameterisable
* Obtaining a **hailstone sequence**, with optional max stopping time.
* The **stopping time**, with optional max stopping time.
* The **reverse function**, _optionally_ parameterisable
* The **graph**/**tree** hailstone equivalent using the reverse function.
