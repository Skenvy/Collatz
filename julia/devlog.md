# Devlog
This will be my first foray into [Julia](https://julialang.org/), so first of all, lets get some [Doc](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) links going.. [Download](https://julialang.org/downloads/) | [Packaging](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/) | [Environs](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/) | [Primer on the package resgistry searchers](https://julialang.org/packages/) | [JuliaHub Packages](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages) | [Julia Packages](https://juliapackages.com/packages) | [**Where to actually submit a package**](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General) | [beautifulalgorithms](https://juliapackages.com/packages/beautifulalgorithms).

Once downloaded, let's start with [the guide for creating a package](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/). The package primer and the guide here make significant mention to the naming expected of a package. The name Collatz would appear wholly appropriate for a package that deals with only that!
