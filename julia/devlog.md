# Devlog
This will be my first foray into [Julia](https://julialang.org/), so first of all, lets get some links going;

Once [downloaded](https://julialang.org/downloads/), let's start with [the guide for creating a package](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/). The [guide here](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/) makes significant mention to the naming expected of a package. The name Collatz would appear wholly appropriate for a package that deals with only that! From the julia folder, `pkg> generate Collatz` does the trick (with pkg version 1.7). For some reason it didn't add my email to the `Project.toml`'s author list, so added manually. However, the name of the folder is of questionable consequence. It appears very heavily customary for julia packages to be singular entites in `X.jl` repos fot a project named `X`, although all guides I can find for it go through steps where a project in a folder `X` is created as a local git repository in `~/.julia/dev/X` and set to target some `X.jl` repo. I'm _assuming_ that when submitting the package, only the name in the `Project.toml` will matter, so rather than have the code in a subfolder, I've copied the contents created by the `pkg> generate Collatz` into the `~/julia/` directory of this repo. We'll have to wait and see I guess.

Some handy blogs ~ [this one](https://syl1.gitbook.io/julia-language-a-concise-tutorial/language-core/11-developing-julia-packages) | [oddly enough, a medium article](https://medium.com/coffee-in-a-klein-bottle/developing-your-julia-package-682c1d309507) | [and this one](https://blog.jcharistech.com/2021/09/27/how-to-develop-and-publish-julia-packages-for-beginners/).

I realise now after reading a lot of the above that while julia packages have genuine CI, the CD is only "semi" automatic (so not properly _continuous_) -- that is to say, there's github actions amongs the links above for testing and building on the package, and can be incorporated as CI, but the CD step does not yet exist, at least, not **_Out of the Box_**, and not as the recommended approach. The [Registrator](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl) linked above is the recommended way of submitting pacakges to [JuliaRegistries/General](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General), which requires [installing the app](https://github.com/apps/juliateam-registrator/installations/new) and commenting `@JuliaRegistrator register` on a commit/branch.

Thankfully, it appears there is a way to [target a subdirectory as "the package"](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl#registering-a-package-in-a-subdirectory) to search for a `Project.toml` instead of the repo root `~/`; for example `@JuliaRegistrator register subdir=path/to/my/package`. We also need to follow the guide to add auto docs from [Documenter](https://juliadocs.github.io/Documenter.jl/stable/man/guide/) (which looks like it came from [this thread](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl/issues/1413)?). The JuMP package is a good example of heavy use of docs. A few different places with examples of docs have different scopes of interpretation for whether `docs/make.jl` should include the deploy or not, but I prefer the `julia --project=some/dir -E/e "commands; to; eval;"` syntax.
