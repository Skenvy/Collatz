Java is obviously a pretty mature language, which unfortunately means there's a bit of an oversaturation of content. These links aren't in the order that they are inherently relevant to deciding how to choose which jdk version or release. They try to be a mix of "how to java" and "how to maven", to coalesce the best way of actually publishing a java project onto maven central. For such a ubiquitous language that's impossible to not find guides on how to _use_ it, because the language, the primary tool for deployment, and the hosting of packages, are all managed by distinct entities, it is surprisingly unintuitive and anti-cohesive an experienve compared to something like python.

Although I'm trying to keep consistently versioned installations across both my windows and WSL environments, it looks like I have several previous temurian installations and java paths injected into system environment variables that it might take a while to clean up. Although for years I'd assumed there was some benefit to sticking with Oracle's release of JDK 8, it looks like I'd previously been using temurian 11, so we'll start off setting up in WSL with a quick `sudo apt update && apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless maven`, only to find that for some reason, WSL has hashed the `mvn` command's path to my window's mvn. So despite `which mvn` yielding `/usr/bin/mvn`; `mvn -v` would indicate `Maven home: /mnt/c/Apache/Maven/3.6.1` (although curiously it dynamically determined the java path to be `/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64`, correct for this context, instead of the windows installation of temurian), `type mvn` came back with a `mvn is hashed (/mnt/c/Apache/Maven/3.6.1/bin/mvn)`. A quick `hash -r mvn`, and `mvn -v` is successfully giving us `Maven home: /usr/share/maven`. We can now initiate the project with;
```
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=org.skenvy.collatz -DartifactId=Collatz -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false -e
```
Which will have created a `~/java/Collatz/` folder, but we want to bring that down one (after the above created the pom using that artifact ID), so we'll just `mv Collatz/* .` and ` rmdir Collatz/`.  

It turns out though that to [set up a project on sonatype](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-guide/#introduction) to host the repository that gets synced with [maven central](https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central), the java-esque style of naming a project/package in reverse DNS order is strongly enforced, so we'll have to immediately recreate the project to [follow these groupID naming requirements](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/coordinates/) which suggests for instance naming the groupID according to the hosting platform along the lines of `io.github.myusername`.
```
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=io.github.skenvy -DartifactId=Collatz -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false -e
```
To acquire the rights to use the `io.github.myusername`-eqsue groupID on sonatype, there's also the additional required step, after having made a ticket to request the registration, to;
* _if you want to use io.github.myusername you must create the public repository OSSRH-TICKETNUMBER like this github.com/myusername/OSSRH-TICKETNUMBER_

I've created [the ticket](https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-81108), but the [Bot Central-OSSRH](https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=central-ossrh) hasn't yet automatically commented requesting the existence of `github.com/myusername/OSSRH-TICKETNUMBER` yet, so I'll just go create it anyway I guess.

A day later, the ticket has been sorted out, so we can start addressing the  additional [publishing requirements](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/).

Now we'll want to set up the release and deployment of the built JAR to OSSRH and GitHub. This'll include adding two profiles to the `pom.xml` to swap between them within the `distributionManagement`'s `repository`. We'll also need to add the javadoc and gpg plugins to the pom. The [gh-actions: publishing with mvn](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-java-packages-with-maven) appears to be incomplete when compared to [Sonatype Publishing: Maven](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-maven/), and it's not clear without looking into it if the github guide is suggesting that set up it automatically handled or not, but the setup java action has input options for gpg, so it seems like we'll need to at least [set up a gpg key for sonatype](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/gpg/). We can `gpg --gen-key` and pick a passphrase, then `gpg --list-keys` to get the key-id, in this case `F398EA6448A7708EAABBB0DEC203EA8449D06C1B`, and send it with;
* `gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-keys F398EA6448A7708EAABBB0DEC203EA8449D06C1B`
* `gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --send-keys F398EA6448A7708EAABBB0DEC203EA8449D06C1B`
* `gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-keys F398EA6448A7708EAABBB0DEC203EA8449D06C1B`

With the key sent to the 3 servers the central repository uses, we can `gpg --armor --export-secret-keys F398EA6448A7708EAABBB0DEC203EA8449D06C1B > private.gpg`, and upload the `MAVEN_GPG_PASSPHRASE`, `MAVEN_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` (the exported key from the last step), `OSSRH_USERNAME`, and `OSSRH_TOKEN` (account password) to github secrets.

Frustratingly, there's a few pieces of this setup that aren't in either the GitHub example, or in any sonatype example, and if you encounter any of a handful of bugs, the only places answers appear to be readily available without digging deeper are in several personal blogs, like the options and profile wrapping of gpg in the pom, and the gpg key phrasing and passing to the github actions. Although that could obviously be gleaned from the setup-java action, it's frustrating that where other github quickstarts to deployment generally work much more out of the box, the maven deployment feels only half baked.
