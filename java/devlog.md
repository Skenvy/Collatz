Java is obviously a pretty mature language, which unfortunately means there's a bit of an oversaturation of content. These links aren't in the order that they are inherently relevant to deciding how to choose which jdk version or release. They try to be a mix of "how to java" and "how to maven", to coalesce the best way of actually publishing a java project onto maven central. For such a ubiquitous language that's impossible to not find guides on how to _use_ it, because the language, the primary tool for deployment, and the hosting of packages, are all managed by distinct entities, it is surprisingly unintuitive and anti-cohesive an experienve compared to something like python.

Although I'm trying to keep consistently versioned installations across both my windows and WSL environments, it looks like I have several previous temurian installations and java paths injected into system environment variables that it might take a while to clean up. Although for years I'd assumed there was some benefit to sticking with Oracle's release of JDK 8, it looks like I'd previously been using temurian 11, so we'll start off setting up in WSL with a quick `sudo apt update && apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless maven`, only to find that for some reason, WSL has hashed the `mvn` command's path to my window's mvn. So despite `which mvn` yielding `/usr/bin/mvn`; `mvn -v` would indicate `Maven home: /mnt/c/Apache/Maven/3.6.1` (although curiously it dynamically determined the java path to be `/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64`, correct for this context, instead of the windows installation of temurian), `type mvn` came back with a `mvn is hashed (/mnt/c/Apache/Maven/3.6.1/bin/mvn)`. A quick `hash -r mvn`, and `mvn -v` is successfully giving us `Maven home: /usr/share/maven`. We can now initiate the project with;
```
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=org.skenvy.collatz -DartifactId=Collatz -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false -e
```
Which will have created a `~/java/Collatz/` folder, but we want to bring that down one (after the above created the pom using that artifact ID), so we'll just `mv Collatz/* .` and ` rmdir Collatz/`.  

It turns out though that to [set up a project on sonatype](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-guide/#introduction) to host the repository that gets synced with [maven central](https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central), the java-esque style of naming a project/package in reverse DNS order is strongly enforced, so we'll have to immediately recreate the project to [follow these groupID naming requirements](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/coordinates/) which suggests for instance naming the groupID according to the hosting platform along the lines of `io.github.myusername`.
```
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=io.github.skenvy -DartifactId=Collatz -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false -e
```
To acquire the rights to use the `io.github.myusername`-eqsue groupID on sonatype, there's also the additional required step, after having made a ticket to request the registration, to;
* _if you want to use io.github.myusername you must create the public repository OSSRH-TICKETNUMBER like this github.com/myusername/OSSRH-TICKETNUMBER_
