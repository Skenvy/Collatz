[The Collatz/Syracuse/3N+1 problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture); notes written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).
## Getting Started
The most recent built PDFs should be accessible [in these "LaTeX" releases](https://github.com/Skenvy/Collatz/releases?q=LaTeX&expanded=true).
<!--
I don't know if I'll ever make this high enough quality to consider putting it on
https://arxiv.org/ but that's really the only place this section would be useful for..

[To install the latest from <package-site-name>](<package-website-specific>);
```sh
<installion-command>
```
-->
## Usage
> [!WARNING]
> These are not very well organised notes, reading them probably won't be a lot of fun.
> The formatting isn't even good yet, and many sections are just stubs.
> The writing of the notes is a TODO.
> The current state is just the way that things were years ago.
<!--
This would only be relevant if I was uploading the results to arxiv and added a landing page on this's gh-pages.

```
